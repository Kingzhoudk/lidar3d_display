CMake Warning at /usr/share/pcl-1.11/PCLConfig.cmake:271 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindVTK.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "VTK", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "VTK" with any of
  the following names:

    VTKConfig.cmake
    vtk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "VTK" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "VTK_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "VTK" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
